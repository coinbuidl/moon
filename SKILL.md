# Moon System Skill

Use this skill for Moon System operations:
1. Plugin lifecycle (`install`, `verify`, `repair`, `post-upgrade`).
2. Moon workflows (`moon-watch`, `moon-snapshot`, `moon-index`, `moon-recall`, `moon-distill`).

## Operating Rule

1. Use `README.md` in this repository as the source of truth for setup, env vars, commands, safety flags, and uninstall.
2. If the `MOON` binary is installed in your `$PATH` (e.g. `~/.cargo/bin/MOON`), run `MOON <command>`. Otherwise, run `cargo run -- <command>` from the repo folder.
3. Prefer JSON mode for automation: `MOON --json <command>` or `cargo run -- --json <command>`.
